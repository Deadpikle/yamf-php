    <p class="message">Hi! Thanks for checking out YAMF, aka Yet Another MVC Framework! YAMF is a small and simple MVC framework to act as a quick-start for your simple PHP applications. There are no external dependencies, so if you're looking for a framework that has many features built in already, please try something like <a href="https://laravel.com" target="_blank">Laravel</a> or <a href="https://cakephp.org" target="_blank">CakePHP</a> or similar frameworks. Otherwise, grab <a href="https://getcomposer.org" target="_blank">Composer</a> for your dependencies, pull them in to your project, and get started!</p>
